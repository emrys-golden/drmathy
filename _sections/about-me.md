[//]: # (About Me)

[//]: # (Currently aiming for high level, who I boil down to professionally, as)
[//]: # (opposed to a short bio. But want feedback on effectiveness from others.)

#### *I enjoy solving biological puzzles with mathematical tools.*

Math and medicine have been my primary interests for as long as I can remember. As a former caregiver, I am *passionate* about making discoveries that **improve clinical care** using the unique lens that comes from the intersection of these two knowledge bases.

I earned my Ph.D. in Applied Mathematics from the University of Washington in 2016, following a B.S. in Mathematics in 2008. During my graduate studies, I spent six months in a research pathology lab studying hepatocellular carcinoma (liver cancer), learning how to culture cells, perform Western blots, and more! *Add one more sentence combining these?*

Further details about my educational background, awards, teaching and mentorship can be found in my [CV](https://drive.google.com/file/d/12hT76A2lRVi6AzYXTV1mY1bBop6ray3I/view?usp=sharing).
