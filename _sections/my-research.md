## Current Research 
I am part of a lab studying glioblastoma, the most common type of brain cancer (and also the most aggressive). In particular, as part of a multi-center effort, we are trying to determine how the incomplete breakdown of the blood-brain barrier affects drug distribution in tumors. For this, I am using noninvasive imaging data from preclinical models to quantitatively assess the contributions of drug distribution and resistance to heterogeneous treatment outcomes.

#### Research Interests Going Forward - needs a better heading here
Through my work with glioblastoma, I've become increasingly interested in the neuroimmune system and biological sex differences, and how variation in normal or healthy biological functioning translates to different incidence and outcome in disease. I am looking to collaborate on projects in this area that will benefit from my quanititave analytical skills to improve precision medicine.

### Previous work
My dissertation research focused on the role of paracrine PDGF signaling in the microenvironment of experimental proneural glioblastoma. Through that work, I demonstrated through mechanistic mathematical modeling that tumors can be driven by changes in the environment, causing "normal" cells to behave like cancer without undergoing mutation. These models were parameterized using experimental data from a PDGF-driven preclinical glioma model, developed by Peter Canoll and his lab at Columbia University College of Medicine.
